                <p>Guam offers almost everything for you stay from hotels to restaurants with good quailty and service. There are only a few beaches one can visit for swimming, however Diving sources ranked Guam as top 5 in the world. I suggest meeting locals ( guamanians ) and hanging out with them.</p>
